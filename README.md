Using tools like Behat and PHPUnit to test changes in a Drupal application involves creating specific test cases and scenarios that reflect real-world usage. Here are examples demonstrating how you might use these tools:

Example with PHPUnit:

Suppose you have a custom Drupal module that includes a service for calculating the discount on products. You want to ensure the discount logic works correctly.

 1. Create a Test Class:

// File: tests/src/Unit/ProductDiscountTest.php
use Drupal\Tests\UnitTestCase;

class ProductDiscountTest extends UnitTestCase {
 protected $discountService;

 public function setUp(): void {
 parent::setUp();
 $this->discountService = new DiscountService();
 }

 public function testApplyDiscount() {
 // Test 10% discount on a $100 product
 $productPrice = 100;
 $discount = 0.10; // 10%
 $expectedPriceAfterDiscount = 90;

 $this->assertEquals(
 $expectedPriceAfterDiscount,
 $this->discountService->applyDiscount($productPrice, $discount),
 'The discount calculation should be correct.'
 );
 }
}


 2. Run the Test:
 • Execute the test using the command line: ./vendor/bin/phpunit -c web/core phpunit.xml.dist tests/src/Unit/ProductDiscountTest.php
 • Check the output to ensure the test passes.

Example with Behat:

Imagine you have a Drupal site where users can register and log in. You want to test the user registration process.

 1. Set Up Behat and Create Feature File:

# File: features/user_registration.feature
Feature: User Registration
 In order to use the site
 As a visitor
 I need to register an account

 Scenario: Register a new user
 Given I am on the homepage
 And I follow "Create new account"
 When I fill in "Username" with "testuser"
 And I fill in "Email" with "test@example.com"
 And I fill in "Password" with "passw0rd"
 And I press "Create new account"
 Then I should see "Registration successful"


 2. Implement Contexts (if not already provided by Drupal extension):
 • You might need to implement custom PHP functions for steps not covered by the Drupal extension.
 3. Run the Feature:
 • Execute Behat: ./vendor/bin/behat features/user_registration.feature
 • Behat will open your site, perform the steps, and report if the scenario passed or failed.

Integrating with Continuous Integration:

For both PHPUnit and Behat:

 • You can integrate these tests into a Continuous Integration (CI) system.
 • Every time you push changes to your repository, the CI system can run these tests automatically, ensuring that changes don’t break existing functionality.
